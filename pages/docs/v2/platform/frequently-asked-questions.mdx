## Platform Version Detection

[<ProductShortName /> CLI](/download) will automatically upgrade your deployment to the latest platform version if you import a project or if your project meets certain criteria. In order for this to work, you must:

- Remove any Dockerfile.
- Remove the `type` property from your `now.json` file.
- Remove the `start` script from your `package.json` file.
- Remove the `server.js` file from the root of your project.

It is possible to opt out of this behavior by creating a `now.json` file with a `version` property.

If you are yet to upgrade to the latest platform version, please read our [upgrade guide](/guides/migrate-to-zeit-now/).

## Green Energy Policy

​<OrgName /> works with multiple cloud partners in order to provide services to end users.

The Serverless approach is an energy-efficient alternative to traditional servers because your code runs only on-demand.

For more information on our cloud partners' Green energy policies, we recommend viewing their documentation:

- [AWS Sustainability Timeline](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/sustainability/sustainability-timeline/)
- [Google Cloud Sustainability](https://cloud.google.com/sustainability/)
- [Microsoft Environmental Sustainability](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/sustainability)

## What can I deploy with <NameWrapper name={PRODUCT_NAME} />?

​<ProductName /> is best at deploying technologies that can be served over HTTP and distributed through our CDN network:

- Static websites and static generators ([Next.js](/guides/deploying-nextjs-with-now), React, Vue, Angular, etc)
- Code that renders HTML on the server-side
- API endpoints that query databases or web APIs and return dynamic data

In general, most popular technologies and languages already have [quickstarts](/docs/v2/introduction#quickstarts) or [guides](/guides) you can start taking advantage of today.

## Missing Public Directory

The [build step](/docs/v2/build-step) will result in an error if the output directory is missing, empty, or invalid (if it’s actually not a directory). To resolve this error, you can try the following steps:

- Make sure that the output directory is specified correctly in project settings. [Here’s the documentation](/docs/v2/build-step#output-directory).
- If the output directory is correct, double check the Build Command ([documentation](/docs/v2/build-step#build-command)) or the root directory ([documentation](/docs/v2/build-step#root-directory)).
- Try running the Build Command locally and make sure that the files are correctly generated in the specified output directory.

## Missing Build Script

<Note>
  This is only relevant if you’re using <ProductShortName /> CLI 16.7.3 or
  older.
</Note>

If your project contains a `package.json` file, no `api` directory, and no `now.json` configuration, it is expected to provide a `build` [script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) that performs a static build of your frontend and outputs it to a `public` directory at the root of your project.

When properly configured, your `package.json` file would look similar to this:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "[my-framework] build --output public"
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>build</InlineCode> script in a{' '}
  <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode> file that specifies the output
  directory.
</Caption>

Once you have defined the `build` [script](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts), this error will disappear. Furthermore, it will not be displayed if you are using `package.json` purely to provide dependencies for your Serverless Functions located inside the `api` directory.

## Broken Preview Deployment Suffix

The Preview Deployment Suffix feature (available optionally on the "General" team settings page) allows for replacing the `now.sh` suffix of every freshly created deployment with a custom domain of your choice.

In order for this feature to function properly, the custom domain you configured must be:

- Active (not deleted)
- Available within the team that enabled the Preview Deployment Suffix
- Backed by an active wildcard certificate

The easiest way to satisfy all of these constraints is to ensure the domain is also added to a project located within the same team. This project would ideally contain a single `index.html` that would display when someone visits the bare domain.

## Maximum Team Member Requests

No more than 10 requests of users wanting to join a team can be open at the same time. In order to allow for more requests, the existing ones have to be approved or declined by an owner of the team.

This ensures the list always remains managable and protected against spam.

## Inviting Users to Team Who Requested Access

If a user already requested access to a team, it's not possible to invite them. Instead, their request must be approved by an owner of the team in order for the user to gain acess.

This ensures no requests are accidentally accepted.

## Unused Project Settings with Non-Zero-Config Deployments

Project settings are only applied to zero-configuration deployments. A deployment that uses the `builds` property will not apply the settings or take them into consideration.
