### Deployment

A collection of files that were uploaded to **<ProductName />**.

#### Preview Deployments

Preview Deployments are the default type of deployment. They are made available by pushing to a git branch through a Git Integration, or by using the `now` command from <ProductShortName /> CLI.

Learn more about [Preview Deployments from the Deployments Concept documentation](/docs/v2/platform/deployments#preview).

#### Production Deployments

Production Deployments are a promoted type of Deployment, made available by merging into a default branch through a Git Integration, or by using the `now --prod` command from <ProductShortName /> CLI

Learn more about [Production Deployments from the Deployments Concept documentation](/docs/v2/platform/deployments#production).

#### Build Step

The Build Step is the process, before a deploymment is made publically available, in which a deployment's source files are constructed to be production-ready output.

Read more about the Build Step in the [Build Step documentation](/docs/v2/build-step).

#### Run Time

Run Time is the process in the deployment lifecycle that the deployment's code is being executed, after successfully being built through during [the Build Step](#build-step).

### Custom Domains

A Custom Domain is a domain that has been added to a user or team for use with a project. Custom Domains are automatically updated when the project they are assigned to gains a new [Production Deployment](#production-deployments).

### Source Files

These are the files contained within your project before it is uploaded with <ProductName />.

### Serverless Function

A serverless code execution handler that can be invoked over the web.

### Static File

A file that is not executed, but instead served as-is to the program sending the request.

### Project

A [structured group of deployments](/docs/v2/platform/projects), categorized by the deployment name.

### Apex Domain

An Apex Domain is a custom domain without an included subdomain. For example, "my-example.com" is an Apex Domain, but "docs.my-example.com" is not.

Apex Domains are sometimes referred to as "naked", "bare", "base", "root", or "zone apex" domains.
