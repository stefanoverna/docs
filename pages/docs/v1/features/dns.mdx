Thanks to the `now dns` CLI command, managing existing DNS records with <ProductShortV1Name /> is simple.

> However, this only applies to domains you bought via <ProductShortV1Name /> or domains configured with our [global DNS service](/world).

In the examples shown below, the placeholder `example.com` represents a domain of your choice that was registered with `now domains` or `now alias`. Here are the main sub-commands you can use:

### now dns ls

Lists all the DNS records available for this domain. The list doesn't include records generated automatically by the nameserver (like a default `SOA` record or `A / AAAA` records created automatically for `ALIAS` records).

### now dns add

Adds a DNS record to a domain of your choice. The following record types are currently supported:

- A
- AAAA
- ALIAS
- CAA
- CNAME
- MX
- SRV
- TXT

This is the syntax for the `now dns` command.

<TerminalInput>
  now dns add &lt;domain&gt; &lt;name&gt; &lt;record type&gt; &lt;value&gt;
  [mx_priority]
</TerminalInput>

- `<domain>` is the domain name
- `<name>` is the subdomain that will be prefixed to `<domain>` (value `@` refers to a domain without any prefix)
- `<record type>` contains one of the supported record types shown above
- `<value>` indicates the value for the record (like an IP address or a hostname)
- `[mx_priority]` sets the priority of a certain MX record and can therefore only be used in conjunction with this record type

<br />

**Examples**

<TerminalInput>
  now <b>dns add example.com ext A 127.0.0.1</b>
</TerminalInput>

Creates an A record that makes the subdomain `ext.example.com` resolve to the server located at the IP address `127.0.0.1.`

<TerminalInput>
  now <b>dns add example.com @ MX mail.awesome-now.us 10</b>
</TerminalInput>

Creates an MX record which makes the mail server located at `mail.awesome-now.us` responsible for handling emails sent to an address suffixed with `@example.com`.

<TerminalInput>
  now <b>dns add example.com @ CAA '0 issue "comodo.com"'</b>
</TerminalInput>

Creates a [CAA record](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/caa/) that allows issuing certificates using [Comodo](https://ssl.comodo.com/) for `example.com` and any subdomain under it.

> In this case, you'll be in charge of certificate management for your domain.<br/>
> Most probably, you'll need to use `CAA` records to:
>
> 1. use a custom certificate for your <ProductShortV1Name /> deployment with <Link href="/docs/features/certs#now-certs-replace">`now certs replace`</Link>
> 2. run an app outside of <ProductShortV1Name /> with TLS for a subdomain

### now dns rm &lt;ID>

Removes a record by ID, which is shown in the `now dns ls` listing. Note that it may take a couple of hours before the change is fully propagated across our infrastructure.
