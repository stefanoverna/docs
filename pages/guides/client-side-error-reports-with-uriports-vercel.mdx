Support for client-side generated reports are the standard for modern web browsers, and enabling this for your projects is a great way to identify and resolve issues, and improve site security, without relying on your users as testers.

[URIports](https://uriports.com) makes these reports free and easy to set up. You will only need to configure a few HTTP headers to start receiving reports.

## What Reports?

Setting up reports with URIports, you can receive a variety of reports to inform you of various cases, including;

- Crash: A visitor was unable to continue because the (mobile) browser crashed.
- Deprecation: A browser API or feature has been used which is expected to stop working in a future update to the browser.
- Intervention: A user-agent has not honored a request made, or javascript function called, by the website or web-based app (e.g., for security, performance, or user annoyance reasons.)
- Network-Error-Logging (NEL): Receive reports on 4xx/5xx HTTP errors, and DNS/TLS related issues. For more information, see the [URIports documentation](https://www.uriports.com/blog/network-error-logging/).
- Content Security Policy (CSP): Reports to help detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, like XSS and data injection, and thereby improve the security of the website or web-based apps.
- Expect-CT: When browsers fail to detect the presence of Signed Certificate Timestamps (SCTs) in subsequent TLS connections. This prevents the use of misused certificates from going unnoticed.
- Feature Policy: The visitor triggered a violation of the Feature Policy. A policy that allows you to selectively enable, disable, or modify the behavior of browser features.

## Step 1: Setting up a project on <NameWrapper name={PRODUCT_NAME} />

[<ProductName />](/) makes it effortless to deploy any static framework and Serverless Function so that you can focus on your project.

Firstly, [signup for a free <OrgName /> account](/signup), then using your project's Git repository, import and deploy your project:

<DeploySection meta={meta} />

Alternatively, you can learn about setting up your project on <ProductName /> or use one of our many Quickstarts from [the <ProductName /> introduction documentation](/docs).

Once deployed, you will receive a default production URL for your project which you will need in the setup of your URIports account. Alternatively, you can [assign a Custom Domain](/docs/v2/custom-domains) to your project.

## Step 2: Setting up URIports and HTTP Headers

URIports collects, aggregates, and enriches all of the reports listed above and presents them in a uniform, easy to navigate interface. With built-in (email and push) notifications, URIports keeps you informed on issues that require attention without the need to regularly log in.

Create an endpoint for your reports by [setting up a free URIports account](https://app.uriports.com/auth/create/).

URIports will ask you for an email, password, and a domain for which your reports will be coming from. The domain will be the production URL that you received for your project in [Step 1](#step-1:-setting-up-a-project-on-zeit-now).

From your URIports dashboard, take note of your Report Endpoint.

Next, create a `now.json` file at the root of your project and fill it with the following contents, replacing `my-report-endpoint` with your endpoint ID:

```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "headers": {
        "Report-To": "{\\\"group\\\":\\\"default\\\",\\\"max_age\\\":10886400,\\\"endpoints\\\":[{\\\"url\\\":\\\"https://my-report-endpoint.uriports.com/reports\\\"}],\\\"include_subdomains\\\":true}",
        "NEL": "{\\\"report_to\\\":\\\"default\\\",\\\"max_age\\\":2592000,\\\"include_subdomains\\\":true,\\\"failure_fraction\\\":1.0}",
        "Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only": "default-src 'self'; font-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; report-uri https://my-report-endpoint.uriports.com/reports/report; report-to default",
        "Expect-CT": "max-age=86400,report-uri=\\\"https://my-report-endpoint.uriports.com/reports/report\\\"",
        "Feature-Policy-Report-Only": "geolocation 'none'; camera 'none'; fullscreen *; payment 'self'"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Step 3: Deploy and Receive Reports

With a <ProductName /> project created and URIports setup for your project, you can now deploy your changes and start receiving reports.

For projects that were deployed from a Git repository, all you need is to push to the default branch (usually `master`) and you will get a fresh production deployment.

Alternatively, run `now --prod` with <ProductShortName /> CLI from your project's root.

That's all! You will now receive reports from your users and be able to act quickly on any issue that arises.

## Avoiding Flooding Your URIports Account

Some report types can potentially flood your URIports account with reports and burn a lot of your quota if they are configured incorrectly.

The following is a few suggestions to help you stop flooding:

- Network-Error-Logging: If you have a high traffic website, you should lower the `failure_fraction` to define a sampling rate. The value must be a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (e.g. 0.05 for 5%.)
- Content Security Policy: Enabling CSP could result in a massive amount of reports when you use external sources like Google Analytics or files hosted on a CDN. If you have not properly set up a CSP yet, we advise you to start by removing the `report-uri` and `report-to` elements from your CSP-header and use the browser's console to track down external sources and add them to your policy before enabling the report features again. Read more about implementing CSP: <https://www.uriports.com/blog/creating-a-content-security-policy-csp/>
