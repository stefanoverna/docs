export const Author = ({ name }) => <span>{name}</span>
export const Type = ({ type }) => <span>{type}</span>

To create a [Preview Deployment](/docs/v2/platform/deployments#preview) for your <Author name={props.name} /> <Type type={props.type} /> with [<ProductShortName /> CLI](/download), make sure you have navigated to the root directory of the project from your terminal.

Using [<ProductShortName /> CLI](/download), deploy your <Type type={props.type} /> with **a single command**:

<Snippet dark text="now" />
<Caption>Deploying your <Author name={props.name} /> <Type type={props.type} /> with <ProductShortName /> CLI.</Caption>

After your project has been deployed, you will be provided with a link to the Preview Deployment, this can be shared immediately.
