Almost every app needs to get configurations at runtime. These configurations could be anything, including:

- Database connection details
- Third-party API keys
- Different customization parameters

The best way to expose these configurations is to do so with [environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable), which is a universally available method that works across various programming languages, operating systems and hosting providers.

Exposing environment variables with <ProductShortV1Name /> is easy.

## Via CLI

You can expose environment variables with the `-e` flag.

<TerminalInput>
  now -e MONGO_URL="user:password@mydb.com" -e MY_API_TOKEN="XXXXX"
</TerminalInput>

You can then access them inside your app.<br/>
If your app is a Node.js app, here's how you can do that:

```
const { MONGO_URL, MY_API_TOKEN } = process.env
```

## Via `now.json`

You can also expose these environment variables with [now.json](/docs/features/configuration). For that, create a file named `now.json` inside your app root and add environment variables like this:

```
{
  "env": {
    "MONGO_URL": "user:password@mydb.com",
    "MY_API_TOKEN": "XXXXX"
  }
}
```

After that, `now` will use above environment variables when you deploy your app.

> It's not a good idea to commit the `now.json` file to [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) if it contains secret information. For that, consider using <Link href="/docs/getting-started/secrets">Secrets</Link>.
