To deploy on <ProductName />, you need to create a **Project**. A Project is a logical structure that groups [deployments](/docs/v2/platform/deployments) and [custom domains](/docs/v2/custom-domains). Each project can be associated to a [GitHub](/docs/v2/git-integrations/vercel-for-github), [GitLab](/docs/v2/git-integrations/vercel-for-gitlab), or [Bitbucket](/docs/v2/git-integrations/vercel-for-bitbucket) repository.

## Creating a Project

You can create a new project from the <OrgName /> Dashboard by clicking on [the New Project button](/new).

## General Settings

### Build & Development Settings and Root Directory

You can edit build and development settings as well as the root directory settings. Check out [our Build Step documentation](/docs/v2/build-step) to learn more.

### Environment Variables

You can configure Environment Variables directly from Project Settings. Check out [the Environment Variables section of our Build Step documentation](/docs/v2/build-step#environment-variables) to learn more.

#### Ony applied starting from your next deployment

As with other project settings, the changes you make to this setting will only be applied starting from your **next deployment**.

<Note>
  When you toggle this setting, none of your existing deployments will be
  affected. If you’d like to make the source code or logs private on your
  existing deployments, the only option is to delete them.
</Note>

## Custom Domains

You can add **custom domains** for each project. Check out [our Custom Domains documentation](/docs/v2/custom-domains) to learn more.

## Git Integration

To edit your project’s Git Integration settings, select the **Git Integration** menu item from your project settings page.

If you’d like to disconnect your project from a Git repository, **empty the field** and save it.

#### Disconnect Your Personal Account or Team

If you’d like to disconnect your **personal account** or **team** from GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket, follow the directions here:

- [Disconnect from GitHub](/docs/v2/git-integrations/vercel-for-github#disconnect-from-github)
- [Disconnect from GitLab](/docs/v2/git-integrations/vercel-for-gitlab#disconnect-from-gitlab)
- [Disconnect from Bitbucket](/docs/v2/git-integrations/vercel-for-bitbucket#disconnect-from-bitbucket)

### Deploy Hooks

​<ProductName /> supports **deploy hooks**, which are unique URLs that accept HTTP POST requests and trigger deployments. Check out [our Deploy Hooks documentation](/docs/v2/more/deploy-hooks) to learn more.

## Security Settings

To edit your project’s security settings, select the **Security** menu item from your project settings page.

### Logs and Source Protection

<Note>
  The changes you make to this setting will only be applied starting from your{' '}
  <b>next deployment</b>.
</Note>

By default, the paths mentioned below can only be accessed by you and members of your Vercel team. Turning off **Logs and Source Protection** will make them publicly accessible.

- `/_src`: Displays the source code and build output.
- `/_logs`: Displays the build logs.

<Note type="warning">
  Do not edit this setting if you don’t want your source code or logs to be
  publicly accessible.
</Note>

### Password Protection

<Note>
  This feature is <em>not</em> available for personal accounts. Only{' '}
  <b>teams</b> can opt into this feature, and the team must be on the{' '}
  <b>
    <Link href="/pricing">Pro</Link>
  </b>{' '}
  or{' '}
  <b>
    <Link href="/pricing">Enterprise</Link>
  </b>{' '}
  plan.
</Note>

By using **Password Protection**, you can ensure that visitors of your Preview Deployments must enter a password in order to gain access.

Teams can opt into using this feature by enabling it from the "Optional" badge and paying <DollarSign />150 per month. Once you opt in, you can use it across other projects in the same team:

  borderRadius
/>
<Caption>Turning on the toggle and specifying the visitor password.</Caption>

After clicking **Save**, all Preview Deployments (existing and future ones) of this project will immediately be protected with a password. If you try to access the page, you’ll be presented with this screen:

<Image
  src={`${process.env.ASSETS}/docs/platform/projects/password-required.png`}
  width={677 / 2}
  height={613 / 2}
  shadow
  borderRadius
/>
<Caption>Password is required.</Caption>

After entering the password, the visitor will be redirected to the deployment. Also, a cookie will be set in the visitor’s browser, giving them access to all Preview Deployments of the project.

#### Protecting Production Deployments

<Caption>Protecting Production Deployment.</Caption>

To protect Production Deployments in addition to Preview Deployments, check **“Also protect my Production Deployment"** and click **Save**.

#### Details

- If you change the password, visitors who have previously entered the password (and therefore have the cookie set) will need to re-enter the password.
- If you disable the protection, all existing deployments of the project will become unprotected.
- If you disable the protection and then enable it, visitors who have the cookie set will continue to be able to access the deployments without re-entering the password.
- You can use Password Protection in conjunction with [SSO Protection](#sso-protection).

#### Disabling the Feature

To opt out from this feature, you can do so from your team’s **Settings** → **Billing** page. Click **Edit** next to **Password Protection** and follow the instructions:

### SSO Protection

<Note>
  This feature is <em>not</em> available for personal accounts. <b>Teams</b> can
  opt into this feature by{' '}
  <Link href="/contact/sales">contacting our sales team</Link>.
</Note>

By using **SSO Protection**, you can ensure that visitors of your Preview Deployments must log in with a personal Vercel account that is a member of your team to gain access.

Teams can opt into using this feature by clicking the "Optional" badge and contacting [our sales team](/contact/sales).

<Caption>Logging in with Vercel is required.</Caption>

If a visitor logs in with a personal Vercel account that’s a member of your team, the visitor will be redirected to the deployment. Also, a cookie will be set in the visitor’s browser, giving them access to Preview Deployments.

**Note**: If you’ve also enabled Password Protection, the login UI will look like this:

<Caption>Protecting Production Deployment.</Caption>

To protect Production Deployments in addition to Preview Deployments, check **“Also protect my Production Deployment"** and click **Save**.

#### Details

- If you disable the protection, all existing deployments of the project will become unprotected.
- If you disable the protection and then enable it, visitors who previously logged into the deployment with Vercel will continue to be able to access the page without logging in again.
- If an account is removed from the team, then that account can no longer be used to access the deployment. The cookie will also become invalid.
- You can use SSO Protection in conjunction with [Password Protection](#password-protection).

## Deleting a Project

<Note type="warning">
  Deleting your project will also delete the deployments and domains within it.
  If you have any deployments that are assigned to a custom domain and do not
  want them to be removed, make sure to deploy and assign them to the custom
  domain under a different project first.
</Note>

To delete a project, choose a project from the [dashboard](/dashboard):
