# Advanced Usage

By default, no configuration is needed to deploy Serverless Functions to <ProductName />.

For all officially supported languages (see below), the only requirement is creating a `api` directory and placing your Serverless Functions inside.

| File Extensions | Language |
| --------------- | -------- |
| .js, .ts        | Node.js  |
| .go             | Go       |
| .py             | Python   |
| .rb             | Ruby     |

In order to customize the Memory or Maximum Execution Duration of your Serverless Functions, you can use the [`functions` property](/docs/configuration#project/functions).

## Community Runtimes

If you would like to use a language that <ProductName /> does not support by default, you can use a Community Runtime by setting the [`functions` property](/docs/configuration#project/functions) in `now.json`:

```json
{
  "functions": {
    "api/test.php": {
      "runtime": "now-php@0.0.7"
    }
  }
}
```

The following Community Runtimes are recommended by <ProductName />:

| Runtime | Runtime Module | Docs                                     |
| ------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| PHP     | `now-php`      | <https://github.com/juicyfx/now-php>     |
| Rust    | `now-rust`     | <https://github.com/mike-engel/now-rust> |

<Note>
  If you would like to create a Community Runtime, see the{' '}

    Developing Your Own Runtime section
  </Link>
  .
</Note>

## Advanced Node.js Usage

In order to use this Runtime, no configuration is needed. You only need to create a file inside the `api` directory.

**The entry point for `src` must be a glob matching `.js` or `.ts` files** that export a default function. For more information on using this Runtime, [see the Node.js Runtime section](#official-runtimes/node-js).

### Disabling Helpers for Node.js

Within a `now.json` configuration file at your project's root, use the following build environment variable to disable [helpers](#official-runtimes/node-js/node-js-request-and-response-objects).

```json
{
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "NODEJS_HELPERS": "0"
    }
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file that will turn off the
  default helpers for your Node.js Serverless Function.
</Caption>

### Private npm Modules for Node.js

To install private npm modules, define `NPM_TOKEN` as a [build environment variable](/docs/configuration#project/build-env) in `now.json`.

Alternatively, define `NPM_RC` as a [build environment variable](/docs/configuration#project/build-env) with the contents of `~/.npmrc`.

### Custom Build Step for Node.js

You can run build tasks by creating a `now-build` script within a `package.json` file at the entry point's level or higher. For example:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "now-build": "node ./build.js"
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode> file with a{' '}
  <InlineCode>now-build</InlineCode> script to execute in the build step.
</Caption>

Along with build script named `build.js`:

```js
const fs = require('fs')
fs.writeFile('built-time.js', (module.exports = '${new Date()}'), err => {
  if (err) throw err
  console.log('Build time file created successfully!')
})
```

<Caption>
  An example Node.js file, executed by the above{' '}
  <InlineCode>package.json</InlineCode> build script.
</Caption>

And a `.js` file for the built Serverless Functions, `index.js` inside the `/api` directory:

```js
const BuiltTime = require('./built-time')
module.exports = (req, res) => {
  res.setHeader('content-type', 'text/plain')
  res.send(`
    This Serverless Function was built at ${new Date(BuiltTime)}.
    The current time is ${new Date()}
  `)
}
```

<Caption>
  An example Node.js Serverless Function, using information from the created
  file from the build script.
</Caption>

### Legacy Serverful Behavior

A Node.js Runtime entrypoint can contain one of the following to retain legacy serverful behavior:

- Default export server, such as `module.exports = http.createServer((req, res) => { res.end('hello') })`.
- Server listens on a port, such as `http.createServer((req, res) => { res.end('hello') }).listen(3000)`.

### AWS Lambda API

The Node.js Runtime provides a way to opt into the [AWS Lambda API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/nodejs-prog-model-handler.html). This is useful if you have existing Serverless Functions you wish to deploy to <ProductName /> but do not want to change the API.

```js
exports.handler = async function(event, context, callback) {
  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    headers: {},
    body: 'Hello world'
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "NODEJS_AWS_HANDLER_NAME": "handler"
    }
  }
}
```

The value of the environment variable needs to match the name of the method that is exported from your Serverless Functions.

## Advanced Go Usage

In order to use this Runtime, no configuration is needed. You only need to create a file inside the `api` directory.

**The entry point of this Runtime is a global matching `.go` files** that export a function that implements the `http.HandlerFunc` signature. For more information on using this Runtime, [see the Go Runtime section](#official-runtimes/go).

### Private Packages for Go

To install private packages with `go get`, define `GIT_CREDENTIALS` as a [build environment variable](/docs/configuration#project/build-env) in `now.json`.

All major Git providers are supported including GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, as well as a self-hosted Git server.

With GitHub, you will need to [create a personal token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with permission to access your private repository.

```json
{
  "build": {
    "env": {
      "GIT_CREDENTIALS": "https://username:token@github.com"
    }
  }
}
```

<Caption>

  environment variable with the value of GitHub credentials.

## Advanced Python Usage

In order to use this Runtime, no configuration is needed. You only need to create a file inside the `api` directory.

**The entry point of this Runtime is a glob matching `.py` source files** with one of the following variables defined:

- `handler` that inherits from the `BaseHTTPRequestHandler` class.
- `app` that exposes a WSGI or ASGI Application.

### Web Server Gateway Interface

The Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) is a calling convention for web servers to forward requests to web applications written in Python. You can use WSGI with frameworks such as Flask or Django.

Instead of defining a `handler`, define an `app` variable in your Python file, when using `now.json` config. For example, define a `index.py` file inside your project as follows:

```python
from flask import Flask, Response
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/', defaults={'path': ''})
@app.route('/<path:path>')
def catch_all(path):
    return Response("<h1>Flask</h1><p>You visited: /%s</p>" % (path), mimetype="text/html")
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>index.py</InlineCode> file, using Flask for a WSGI
  application.

Inside `requirements.txt` define:

```
flask==1.0.2
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>requirements.txt</InlineCode> file, listing{' '}
  <InlineCode>flask</InlineCode> as a dependency.
</Caption>

### Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface

The Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) is a calling convention for web servers to forward requests to asynchronous web applications written in Python. You can use ASGI with frameworks such as [Sanic](https://sanic.readthedocs.io).

Instead of defining a `handler`, define an `app` variable in your Python file.

For example, define a `index.py` file inside a folder as follows:

```python
from sanic import Sanic
from sanic.response import json
app = Sanic()


@app.route('/')
@app.route('/<path:path>')
async def index(request, path=""):
    return json({'hello': path})
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>index.py</InlineCode> file, using Sanic for a ASGI
  application.

Inside `requirements.txt` define:

```
sanic==19.6.0
```

## Developing Your Own Runtime

Extending the feature-set of a <ProductName /> deployment is as simple as creating a Runtime that takes a list of files and outputs either static files or dynamic [Serverless Functions](/docs/v2/serverless-functions/introduction/).

[A full API reference is available to help with creating Runtimes.](https://github.com/zeit/now/blob/master/DEVELOPING_A_RUNTIME.md)

---

## Technical Details

### Caching Data

A runtime can retain an archive of up to `100mb` of the filesystem at `build` time. The cache key is generated as a combination of:

- Project name.
- Team id or user id.
- Entrypoint path (e.g., `api/users/index.go`).
- Runtime identifier including version (e.g.: `@now/go@0.0.1`).

The cache will be invalidated if any of those items changes. The user can bypass the cache by running `now -f`.

### Limits

- Runtimes can run for a maximum of 5 minutes before the execution times out.
- The maximum cache archive size of a Runtime is 100mb.
- The cache TTL is 7 days.

### Including Additional Files

Most Runtimes use static analysis to determine which source files should be included in the Serverless Function output based on the build `src` input. Any unused code or assets is ignored to ensure your Serverless Function is as small as possible.

For example, the Node Runtime looks at calls to `require()` or `fs.readFile()` in order to determine which files to include automatically.

<Code lang="javascript">{`// index.js
const { readFileSync } = require('fs');
const { join } = require('path');
const file = readFileSync(join(__dirname, 'config', 'ci.yml'), 'utf8');
`}</Code>
<Caption>
    This <InlineCode>/index.js</InlineCode> file reads the contents of{' '}
    <InlineCode>/config/ci.yml</InlineCode>.<br />
    The use of <InlineCode>__dirname</InlineCode> is necessary to read a file relative
    to the current file.
  </Caption>

In some cases, you may wish to include templates or views that are not able to be statically analyzed. Runtimes provide a configuration for `includeFiles` that accepts a glob of files that will always be included in the Serverless Functions output.

<Code lang="json">{`{
  "functions": {
    "api/test.js": {
      "includeFiles": "templates/**"
    }
  }
}`}</Code>
