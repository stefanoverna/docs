​<ProductShortV1Name /> for GitHub is an app for GitHub users or organizations that automatically deploys and aliases changes to repositories with <ProductShortV1Name />.

The <ProductShortV1Name /> for GitHub integration features:

- Deploys every push in branches and pull requests to preview changes live
- Aliases the most recent changes from the master branch
- Instant rollbacks when reverting changes that have been aliased

## Connecting the App to Your Github Account or Organization

​<ProductShortV1Name /> for GitHub is directly connected with your <OrgV1Name /> account and can be linked from within your [account](/account) or team settings. Within the settings page under the "General" tab, the first section will offer for you to install <ProductShortV1Name /> for GitHub if it is not already installed.

Clicking the "Install <ProductShortV1Name /> for GitHub" button will take you to GitHub where they will prompt you, if you have an account belonging to any organizations, which profile the installation should be installed with. You can pick either your GitHub account or any of the organizations you have access to.

If you are not part of any organization, you will skip straight to the repository selection.

For organizations that you have limited permissions for, GitHub will ask you to request access to install the integration. Once requested, the organization's owner will need to approve the integration.

<Caption>The account or organization selection step on GitHub.</Caption>

With an account or organization selected, GitHub will now ask for which repositories <ProductShortV1Name /> for GitHub should work with. In this step you are able to allow all repositories to be deployed or an optional set of repositories.

With the GitHub profile and repositories chosen for <ProductShortV1Name /> for GitHub to work with, the application will be ready to start using. The next step is to prepare the repository for <ProductShortV1Name /> to deploy.

## Usage

​<ProductShortV1Name /> for GitHub requires a `now.json` file to exist in the root of the repository to begin deploying that repository.

A `now.json` file is a way to configure the deployments <ProductShortV1Name /> will make using your code. To get started deploying from your repository, the `now.json` configuration does not need any specific setup, you will only need a valid JSON file. For example, you can use an empty object (`{}`) for the file to be valid and recognized by <ProductShortV1Name /> to start deploying.

With the repository correctly configured, <ProductShortV1Name /> for GitHub will start deploying the app.

## Default Behaviour

### A Deployment for Each Push

​<ProductShortV1Name /> for GitHub will **deploy every push by default**. This includes pushes to any branch that includes a `now.json` and any pull requests made from those branches. This allows those working within the repository to preview changes made before the changes are pushed to production.

### Aliasing the Default Branch

If [an alias is set within the `now.json` file](/docs/features/aliases), pushes and merges to the [default branch](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-the-default-branch/) (commonly "master") will be aliased automatically and made live to those aliases with the latest deployment made with a push.

For example, the following `now.json` configuration will make <ProductShortV1Name /> for GitHub alias the most recent push to `example.com` by default.

```json
{
  "alias": ["example.com"]
}
```

## Configuration

### Disabling <NameWrapper name={PRODUCT_SHORT_V1_NAME} /> for GitHub with `now.json`

To disable <ProductShortV1Name /> for a GitHub repository, use the following configuration option in the `now.json` file:

```
{
  "github": {
    "enabled": false
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  This example is of an entire <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file with the
  noted configuration option to disable <ProductShortV1Name /> for GitHub.
</Caption>

Disabling <ProductShortV1Name /> for GitHub with this configuration option will prevent <ProductShortV1Name /> from [deploying any push](#a-deployment-for-each-push) or [aliasing the changes](#aliasing-the-default-branch) when merged to the default branch.

### Disabling Auto-Aliasing

To stop <ProductShortV1Name /> from [automatically aliasing the default branch](#aliasing-the-default-branch) to any alias setup within the `now.json` file, use the following configuration option.

```
{
  "alias": ["example.com"],
  "github": {
    "autoAlias": false
  }
}
```

<Caption>
  This example is of an entire <InlineCode>now.json</InlineCode> file with the
  noted configuration option to disable auto-aliasing with{' '}
  <ProductShortV1Name /> for GitHub. The file also includes an example setup
  alias.
</Caption>

### Disable Commenting with Silent Mode

You can enable the silent mode and ask us to stop commenting on pull requests and commits. Even though we stop adding comments, we will continue to add commit status.

This is a per repo setting. You can enable it by adding the following configuration option to the `now.json` file:

```
{
  "github": {
    "silent": true
  }
}
```

### Disable Auto Job Cancellation

To stop <ProductShortV1Name /> from canceling in-progress builds to prioritise building newer commits, use the following configuration option in [a `now.json` file](/docs/v1/features/configuration) for the repository that this behaviour should exist in.

```
{
  "github": {
    "autoJobCancelation": false
  }
}
```

## Included Environment Variables

You may want to use different workflows and use different APIs based on Git information.<br/>
In order to support that, <ProductShortV1Name /> will deploy your app with following built-in environment variables.

```
{
"NODE_ENV": "production",
"NOW_GITHUB_DEPLOYMENT": "1",
"NOW_GITHUB_ORG": "zeit",
"NOW_GITHUB_REPO": "simple-now-app",
