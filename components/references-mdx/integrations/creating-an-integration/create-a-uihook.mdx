## Step 2: Creating a UIHook

This step will detail the creation of a UIHook for a counter application. This example explains the basics for how an UIHook works.

First, create an `index.js` file and add the following code:

```js
const { withUiHook } = require('@zeit/integration-utils')

let count = 0

module.exports = withUiHook(({ payload }) => {
  count += 1
  return `
    <Page>
      <P>Counter: ${count}</P>
      <Button>Count Me</Button>
    </Page>
  `
})
```

<Caption>
  An example <InlineCode>index.js</InlineCode> file for a <OrgName />{' '}
  Integration.
</Caption>

Inside the [UIHook](/docs/integrations#understanding-uihooks) there is a variable, `count`. Every time the [Button](#component-catalog/action-components/button) is clicked, the UIHook is called, thus updating the counter and **providing the updated HTML as a response**.

This is happening inside the <OrgName /> Dashboard under a configuration page for this Integration.

  You can find more complex examples{' '}
  <Link href="/docs/integrations#examples/">later in the documentation</Link> or
  you can view the code on the{' '}

</Note>

### Running the UIHook Locally

With the [help of `now dev`](/docs/v2/development/basics), you can run your UIHook locally inside a **simulation of the <ProductName /> platform**.

By running your UIHook locally, you can test that your Integration, after creating the Integration with <OrgName />, behaves as expected before deploying your Integration to production. This will be explored further in the next section.

To run the UIHook locally, create a `now.json` file and add the following:

```js
{
  "name": "my-ui-hook",
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [{ "src": "index.js", "use": "@now/node" }]
}
```

Then, run the following commands:

<TerminalInput>npm install</TerminalInput>
<TerminalInput>now dev --listen 5005</TerminalInput>
