We require some permissions through our <ProductShortName /> for GitHub integration. Below are listed the permissions required and a description for what they are used for.

#### Repository Permissions

Repository permissions allow us to interact with repositories belonging to or associated with (if permitted) the connected account.

| Permission        | Read | Write | Description                                                                                                               |
| ----------------- | ---- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Administration`  | Y    | Y     | Allows us to create repositories on the user's behalf.                                                                    |
| `Checks`          | Y    | Y     | Allows us to add checks against source code on push.                                                                      |
| `Contents`        | Y    | Y     | Allows us to fetch and write source code for new project templates for the connected user or organization.                |
| `Deployments`     | Y    | Y     | Allows us to synchronize deployment status between GitHub and the <OrgName /> infrastructure.                             |
| `Pull Requests`   | Y    | Y     | Allows us create deployments for each Pull Request (PR) and comment on those PR's with status updates.                    |
| `Issues`          | Y    | Y     | Allows us to interact with Pull Requests as with the `Pull Requests` permissions due to GitHub requiring both for access. |
| `Metadata`        | Y    | N     | Allows us to read basic repository metadata to provide a detailed dashboard.                                              |
| `Web Hooks`       | Y    | Y     | Allows us to react to various GitHub events.                                                                              |
| `Commit Statuses` | Y    | Y     | Allows us to synchronize commit status between GitHub and <OrgName />.                                                    |

#### Organization Permissions

Organization permissions allow us to offer an enhanced experience through information about the connected organization.
