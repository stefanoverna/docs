# Project Level APIs

Deployments made with <ProductName /> are grouped into Projects. This means that each deployment is assigned a name and is grouped into a project with other deployments using that same name.

Users can deploy projects for any type of app. For example, there could be:

- A project for a marketing website.
- A project for a backend API.
- A project for an admin dashboard.
- A project with all three in a monorepo.

Using a <OrgName /> Integration, you can modify configuration for whole projects, for which we expose a set of API endpoints:

<ProjectBasedEnvVars />
<UtilsInsideIntegrationUtils />
<UsingTheApiDirectly />
