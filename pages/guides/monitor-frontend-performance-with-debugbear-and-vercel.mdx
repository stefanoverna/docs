[DebugBear](https://www.debugbear.com/) is a website monitoring tool that helps developers keep track of site performance and [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) scores.

This guide walks you through setting up continuous monitoring for your production sites, as well as automatic testing of every [Preview Deployment](/docs/v2/platform/deployments#preview).

## Step 1: Import and Deploy with <NameWrapper name={PRODUCT_NAME} />

<DeploySection meta={meta} />

## Step 2: Install the DebugBear <NameWrapper name={ORG_NAME} /> Integration

With your project set up with <OrgName />, install the [DebugBear integration](/integrations/debugbear) from the [<OrgName /> Integrations Marketplace](/integrations) to add it to your account.

Select the account or team your deployed project belongs to. You will then be redirected to DebugBear.

## Step 3: Set Up a DebugBear Account

If you do not have a DebugBear account already, click **Create account** on DebugBear to automatically sign up with your <OrgName /> email address. Otherwise, you can continue with your existing account.

When logged in with DebugBear, select which of your <OrgName /> projects you would like to monitor and click **Set up**.

DebugBear will automatically start monitoring your project's homepage and up to 3 other pages on your site.

<Note>It may take a few minutes for reports to come in.</Note>

By default these pages are tested once a day from a US-based server, but you can change these settings later. Additionally, you can add any extra pages you would like to monitor.

## Step 4: Push Changes on a Branch

Make some changes to your project, then push the branch to your git repository. <OrgName /> will create a [Preview Deployment](/docs/v2/platform/deployments#preview), and DebugBear will test the performance of the deployed site.

You can see test results for your deployment in any of these places:

- The integration configuration page on <OrgName />
- The project Builds tab on DebugBear
- Posted to a [Slack](https://www.debugbear.com/docs/slack-integration#api-builds) channel
- Or, on GitHub (described in [the next section](#option:-sending-reports-to-github))

  If you see a drop in your SEO score, this may be because DebugBear is
  comparing a preview deployment, that's blocked from indexing, to the
  production site.
</Note>

### Selecting Pages to Test

You can [configure](https://www.debugbear.com/docs/zeit#url-filter) which of your monitored pages should be tested after each deployment. Normally you don't need to change anything here, but if you use a custom deployment suffix other than `now.sh` you need to specify it.

### Build Statuses

By default, all DebugBear tests will finish in a `neutral` state. To get meaningful `pass` or `failure` results you need to set up a [performance budget](https://www.debugbear.com/docs/performance-budgets) that defines metric thresholds that shouldn't be exceeded.

## Send Reports to GitHub

If you use GitHub, DebugBear can report test results directly on your pull request. You need to [install the DebugBear GitHub app](https://www.debugbear.com/docs/github-integration).

1. Go to the **Integrations** tab of your DebugBear project and connect your user account to GitHub.

2. Click **Install Github integration** and grant access to the repository that contains your <OrgName /> site.

After your next deployment, you will see one commit status on your GitHub pull request for each tested page.
