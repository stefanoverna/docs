## Why Build or Use an Integration?

Integrations are perfect for you if you want to pair <OrgName />'s functionality with other services or want to extend <OrgName />'s functionality itself.

An example of this is the [Google Cloud Integration](/integrations/gcloud) which connects projects on <OrgName /> to Google Cloud Platform projects where you can run <ProductName /> deployments as CRON jobs through the Google Cloud Scheduler, Create and connect to MySQL/PostgreSQL databases with Google Cloud SQL, and much more that would be a lot harder without an Integration.

Many more Integrations that help users in similar ways can be created using the <OrgName /> Integrations API in partnership with the <OrgName /> API and any external service with an API.
